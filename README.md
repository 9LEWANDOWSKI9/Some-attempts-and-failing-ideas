# Some-attempts-and-failing-ideas
When cleaning up all the codes that I have written in previous years, I find some failing ideas that came up to my mind at some specific time when doing reasearch.

For example, "W值算法" is a new way to calculate the membership between features and concepts based on the expert matrix. This inspiration comes from the iou value from RCNN, I think this calculation method can be applicated in the membership calculation, but finally it failed because of lacking interpretability. Although the result seems a little better, it is meaningless and will not be admitted, so I give up.
