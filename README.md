# Some-attempts-and-failing-ideas
When cleaning up all the codes that I have written in previous years, I find some failing ideas that came up to my mind at some specific time when doing reasearch.

For example, "W值算法" is a new way to calculate the membership between features and concepts based on the expert matrix. This inspiration comes from the iou value from RCNN, I think this calculation method can be applicated in the membership calculation, but finally it failed because of lacking interpretability. Although the result seems a little better, it is meaningless and will not be admitted, so I give up.

I also try many things such as combine RCNN and AFSnn.

Here comes to a thinking that why I mainly focus on combination all the alive networks instead of thinking about what the real usage of the result. 

Now, I think that all the things should be result-based or application-based, that is, all the things that we create should have their own functions and real applications in real life to benefit more people, only in this way, all the things we have done now are meaningful and priceless.
